# rfa_sort

The goal of rfa_sort is to provide a `DataTable` from the [active NIH RFAs](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/search_results.htm?scope=rfa&year=active).  

The live version of this page is located at: https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/rfa_sort/

To use this, simply clone the repo, open the repo using `rfa_sort.Rproj` and then run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shiny::runApp()
