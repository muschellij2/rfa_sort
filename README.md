# rfa\_sort

The goal of rfa\_sort is to provide a `DataTable` from the [active NIH
RFAs](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/search_results.htm?scope=rfa&year=active).

The live version of this page is located at:
<https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/rfa_sort/>

To use this, simply clone the repo, open the repo using `rfa_sort.Rproj`
and then run:

``` r
shiny::runApp()
```
